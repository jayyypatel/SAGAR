                    but goes beyond it. Often people are self-assured that they are expert, skilled in their domain area
                    and hardly pay attention to clarity of expression and communication behaviors. In reality,
                    Communication is a learned verbal and non-verbal skill that must be continually refined. Further,
                    the corporate sector has diverse culture for production enhancement which calls for every employee
                    to be well versed with communication strategies. It requires a high level of communication
                    competence-an awareness of whatâ€™s appropriate for the situation, person, the skills to perform in a
                    specific fashion, and the motivation to do so. Additionally, the effectiveness of an employee grows
                    from a willingness to accept the challenges arising out of cross-cultural communication. So,
                    corporate communication includes strategically, clearly and logically organizing thoughts followed
                    by communicating expectations, explanations, asking, informing and responding to the
                    person/situation. Certainly, the role of communication in corporate is complex. One needs to
                    acquaint self with the art and science of effective communication. </p>

                    Corporate counseling services focus on working with groups and individual employees around their
                    feelings and reactions to events that can spark challenging emotional responses. Counseling takes
                    care of employeeâ€™s mental health and emotional well-being with a resulting increase in personal
                    awareness and self-efficacy. Corporate counseling aims at engaging employees in making healthy
                    lifestyle choices by providing the employees and the organization with the tools, resources, and
                    knowledge to create a health supportive work environment. Corporate Counseling also offers workshops
                    and programs for leadership development and structured mentoring programs.
